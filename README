Introduction
============

__HeftyBox__ is a project currently under development to facilitate the need for front end designers to provide an easy-to-navigate solution for choosing from many items. Multiple Select boxes and Checkboxes alone can be cumbersome, take up lots of space, and can be confusing for a user.

The idea behind __HefyBox__ is to provide a dynamically generated list of items based off a pre-existing Multiple Select box. The list will then be equipped with a textbox used to dynamically filter through the list, allowing the user to quickly navigate through items.

Primary Concepts
================

  - The HeftyBox should be dynamic and not affect any attributes or user input that coould be collected by the original Select box
  - The HeftyBox should accept many options to match styling and uniqueness of the application it is being used for
  - The HeftyBox should be able to be modified and customized with calls to the object after it is initiated
  - The HefyBox should be easy to implement, attractive, and functional with defualt setting

Long Term Goals
===============

  - Create a well documented and neat plugin with rolling updates
  - Create a ruby gem for easy implementation into Ruby on Rails based applications
  - Add classes pertaining to jQueryUI to allow theming and styling
  - Implement AJAX functionality for items

Short Term Goals
================

  - Have code refactored and reviewed by the community and by people who know far more than I do
  - Publicize this Git repository
  - Recruit developers interested in building this project
